            <div class="col">
                <p>The purpose of this project was to assess the inequities of the current-state Hollerbachs.com website. </p>
                <p> This was the first team project of a UX bootcamp and consisted of 2 people conducted remotely. While we worked together, I took lead on Site Mapping, Card Sorting (both open and closed) as well as Tree Testing. I also contributed heavily to Content Inventory and Design elements although  my partner took the lead on elements. </p>
                <p>This project was completed in one week's time with a $0 budget. It was very clear from  inception which direction the company needed to head and the decision was further supported by the collected data.</p>
                <p>Based on initial navigations of the site it was abundantly clear that it needed direction. With a plethora of content, users would need clear pathways to find information quickly. We hypothesized that users would positively respond to choosing which business to patron right from the beginning. So we set out to prove it using open and closed card sorts and mockups.</p>
                <p>All data was collected using UXTweak and illustrated using Figma and Canva.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-padding"> At the beginning of this project we knew that we needed to catalogue the entire website including hidden pages (found via SERP) and made a cohesive presentable site map with corresponding reference numbers for future wireframing and mockups. We did this so as to see everything that our client has to offer one clean space.</p>
            <p>In this case, it illustrated one of the main problems with the site, that it was overwhelming and poorly organized. Through a complete cataloguing, especially via SERP  we were immediately able to discover dozens of pages that should be unpublished.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, by creating this sitemap, we were able to establish clear current-state categorical heirarchies, something that would later prove to be an organizational nightmare. This also identified confusing name associations, and a distinct lack of clarity in regards to the separation of the 4 businesses.</p>

                <p>I conducted user card sorting of 10 users with topics gathered from the content inventory in order to establish and confirm what was hypothesized -the site had an overwhelming amount of content that without direction could not effectively be organized. While some items were able to be sorted, ultimately, no clear categories emerged. *Given the appropriate budget for rewards I would have increased the number of users surveyed to increase the data pool.</p>
                <p>As you can see, the only items that were consistently grouped together were "Food" items, and because of the poor organization of the current-state, several of the assocated items were under the wrong business umbrella.

                <p>After establishing the quagmire that existed with the current-state, I was able to introduce a more structured approach with closed card sorting. By clearly providing categories, users were more consistently able to organize the site's content. Testing this hypothosis, I utlized UXTweak again, this time testing 3 users with the categories provided. The results were indicative that the site needed better organization and categorization.</p>

                    <p>In its current-state, one of the 4 business entities of Hollerbach's (Hollerbach's Outfitters) was hosted on it's own domain. It was the recommendation of my team to incorporate this entitiy back into the main domain. You will notice the sitemap changes contained by red perforated stroke are those affected by this separate domain. </p>
                    <p>Overall, we suggested a complete restructuring of the website. This new sitemap suggests asking users to decide which of the 4 business entities they are looking to patron from the first click. By encouraging users to decide upfront, we hypothesized that users would be able to complete business specific task with a substantially greater ease.</p>
                    <p>You can see this site map is greatly reduced without any loss of content.</p>

             <p>During this project, I began to understand the importance of site infrastructure. It does not matter how much content you have on the site when users are unable to located and use said information. The website in question, hollerbachs.com, was a perfect example of a business that was in need of help; working on this project allowed me to see first hand how important purposeful and clear design truly is in regards to the user's experience. This was my first UX project with a partner and I was able to cement the value in the concept of divide and conquer.  </p>
