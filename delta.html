                    <p>I explored the website to uncover ways to improve it, but because I found no major usability violations, or lacking features, I turned to user study to discover if any current features were underrepresented or unutilized.</p>

                <div class="col order-2">
                    <p>I wanted to learn more about which features were most important to the user, understand the user’s motivations for using the website, and how users thought and experienced what they perceived as difficulties within the site.</p>
                    <p>I first determined criteria that defined my targeted users. Then, I wrote interview questions creating a discussion guide. I prepared possible follow-up questions and tried to anticipate possible answers without biasing the questions.</p>
                    <p>Next, we sourced people meeting the criteria; they are now my targeted users. I spoke with a total of 1 male and 5 females. Key questions I asked included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tell me about the last time you used Delta.com.</li>

                    <p>One of, ultimately, the most valuable follow up questions that I posed revolved around the use of Delta Vacations, a service that bundles flight/car/hotel. Responses to this followup, through data synthesization and analysis, proved to be a dilemma.  </p>

She views taking trips as a hobby and frequently visits Delta.com to plan trips. She is a SkyMiles member and values the program. She prefers to book on the web, but uses the application to access boarding documents, skymiles metrics, etc. She loves that Delta.com matches the sophistication and class that she experiences on board. She hates feeling confused and prefers to know all of her options.</p>
                <p>Utilizing Sandra I was able to develop a problem space to work in and swiftly begin crafting a tailored solution through prototyping.</p>

                <p>I reviewed the exploratory findings to determine possible opportunities that I might pursue. With the website being so well-done, it was difficult to uncover the area where I could actually make an improvement. At this point, I only knew that users, while enticed by the SkyMiles program, were often using the website to plan vacations; however, they were neither aware of nor using the Delta Vacations section of the website.</p>

                <p>I created a scenario and task to see how users are currently navigating the website in an attempt to complete the task. </p>
                <p>The task asked users to assist Sandra in booking a bundled vacation for herself and her family to Paris in March. She needed flights, a car, and a hotel. What was interesting about this is how long it took users to find this information. While sitting in the airport waiting for my flight, I conducted user testing with 10 real life Delta customers, timing them on how long it took them to get to the correct page. On average, in the current state, it took 53.2 seconds. </p>
                <p>During this stage of testing, I was able to hear more frustrations with the site; irritations with information sorting, annoyance of lack of promotion/highlighting for Delta Vacations and others. In fact, of the 10 users tested in the airport, none were aware of the Delta Vacations Program.</p>
                <p>The current flow provided that users navigate to a subcategory (Travel Info) of the Navigation Bar before discovering the Delta Vacations link, buried in the third column.  Users were also able to navigate by scrolling and clicking a button labeled “Vacation Deals” which took them to an external site (meetdeltavacations.com) only to link them back to the Delta Vacations page (hosted on Delta.com) to complete the task. This proves problematic for many reasons, primarily because its not best practice to lead customers away from your site.</p>

                <p>I examined my research and findings and came to the conclusion that Delta Vacations needed it’s own section in the Navigation bar.

                <p>By incorporating my suggested changes, I was able to reduce the amount of time spent getting to the Delta Vacations page from a 53.2 second average to a 10.4 second average. That is a decrease in time taken to complete the task of 80%.</p>
                <p>Prototype testing confirmed that my modifications were effective, and also provided me with stylistic and aesthetic suggestions on how to improve the design. These suggestions were weighed and implemented in the final client deliverable.</p>

<!-- Recap/ Outcomes and Lessons Learned -->

<div class="section">
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <h2>With my solution, Delta.com users are more readily exposed to Delta Vacations and can utilize the service in fewer clicks.</h2>
        <div class="col">
            <p>Ultimately, I worked diligently to uncover usability problems and an under-tapped revenue source for a multi-billion dollar well oiled machine.  I produced a modified user flow chart as well as several stages of prototypes (both mobile and desktop) to meet the needs of the client as well as satisfy users needs for usability.</p>
            <p>My solution was multifaceted - first, I added a new tab/button for “Delta Vacations” to the navigation bar on the desktop website.  With center placement and Delta Red text, this will immediately grab the attention of users that otherwise wouldn't know this service exists. Furthermore, this will reduce the amount of clicks required to access the service. Also, the current state provides that there is a link in the body of the main page that takes users to meetdeltavacations.com; a site that ultimately links users back to delta.com to complete the transaction. This unnecessary step has been removed as well. Similarly, in mobile view, Delta Vacations (again in Delta Red) is given its own tab in the hamburger menu.</p>
            <p>Technical skills: 
                <ul>
                    <li>I learned how to produce working prototypes using both mobile and web platforms. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Soft skills: 
                <ul>
                    <li>I also learned the importance of quickly changing strategy; Heuristic Evaluations and Competitive Feature Analysis uncovered virtually no problem areas. Also, because of the well designed current state of the site, tree testing was unable to showcase the problem empirically.  It was quickly clear that conducting user testing was the most effective method of quantifying the problem.</li>
                </ul>
