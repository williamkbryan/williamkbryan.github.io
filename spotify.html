                     <p>Spotify is an online streaming media service that provides users access to a databases of content (i.e. artists, albums, tracks, playlists, etc). We specifically target veteran Spotify Users with 5+ years of daily use. We were able to identify usability trends, compile and analyze to create succinct implementable modifications. </p>
                     <p>This was a collaborative remote project containing 3 team members, myself included.  We developed Heurstic Evaluations as well and completed detailed Competitive Feature Analysis with competitors (Pandora, SoundCloud, and YouTube Music).</p>
                     <p>While each team member was charged with specific tasks and responsibilities, we worked cohesively to present finalized offerings in 1 week's time with a $0 budget. I personally was able to conduct user interviews (based from a discussion guide created by another team member), plot, then synthesize this data through affinity mapping, and compile a distinct persona of the application’s users. </p>
                     <p>After discovering some minor problem areas, I was able to visually represent projected solutions through the forms of low, mid, and high fidelity wireframing and ultimately a presentation ready mockup including functional prototype.</p>

                         <p>We conducted a heuristic evaluation and competitive feature analysis to assess the current-state usability of the application. We explored the features competitors offered in their applications to better understand the market. We used these methods to gather a baseline understanding of the Spotify application and it's place in the market before speaking with actual users.</p>
                         <p>Upon examination, we discerned that the application, as it stood, was adequate for the average user and didn't have many usability issues.  However, we noticed that there could be some improvements with ease of use options, specifically issues with the Match between System and Real World, Recognition vs Recall, and Help and Documentation.  There were issues with word choice which confused users as well as application organization that did not lead to a flexible, easy to use experience. </p>
                         <p>We were able to identify several problem areas from our perspective then turned to users to gather data to see if these problems were shared issues with users or if other problems existed.</p>

             <div class="col justified-content-center" >
                 <p>We created a scenario and two tasks to see how users are currently navigating the app in an attempt to complete the task. </p>
                 <p>The first task asked users to locate a specific playlist from a specific subgenre of music featuring a specific artist. The goal of this was to see if users would attempt to to interact with the genre page of the application or discard that pathway entirely. Our testing indicated that users immediately went to the search bar, and 0 out of 6 users attempted to find the playlist using the genre/categories section. </p>
                 <p>The second task was designed to see how users would find a playlist given only certain information. They were given the playlist cover art, author, and genre tags, but were not given the actual name of the playlist.  5 out of 6 users immediately went to the profile page of the playlist creator. Here’s where things got interesting. In its current version, Spotify allows you to browse a profile’s playlists, but it limits the number presented and also lacks a search feature. Users spent on average just shy of 4 minutes (3:54) unsuccessfully browsing the provided playlists before realizing they were unable to complete the task in that manner.</p>
